# Instrument respopnse for PDIAR sensor 4
#
# Empirical data provided by Dr. R.W Whitaker of LANL
# Phase response is not known at this time
# Digitizer and antialias responses not known at this time
# Nominal setting for high gain is 0.2v/microbar
# Normalized to 0.5 Hz
#
# Calib:  20Volts/4096 counts X 1microbar/0.2Volt X 0.1Pa/1microbar
#       = (20/4096)X(1.0e-6/0.2)X(0.1/1.0e-6) = 2.4414e-3 Pa/count
# Calper: 2 sec
